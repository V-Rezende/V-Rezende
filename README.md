Hello there, I'm Vinni, a passionate Front End Developer on an exciting journey. ðŸš€

ðŸ§­ My path began in Sport Science and Logistics, where precision was key. 
Now, I'm devoted to web development. 
As a former swim coach, breaking down complexity into manageable steps is second nature. 
I bring the same dedication to coding.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm immersed in front-end magic, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web tech like Bootstrap and React. Every day is an opportunity to learn, create, and enhance user experiences.

ðŸ™Œ Known for my hard work and discipline, I thrive in collaborative environments, using my unique background and adaptability to solve problems creatively. Challenges are chances to learn.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and explore the possibilities in the dynamic world of web development.
